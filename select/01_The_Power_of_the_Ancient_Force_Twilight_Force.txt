Stars are shining on a bright night
A hero is rising, guided by light
Fire, glorious fire
Burning within his heart

In a land of mighty warriors
Honour and glory, eternally
Wisdom, oh, holy wisdom
Dwelling within his sword

Thousands of universes burn before my eyes
Tales of ancient prophecies
Came true and left again
History was carved anew
And lit the hope of men
And the knights of twilight's might will rise again

For the power of the ancient force
Stars are shining
Riding on the winds of light
Twilight Force

Fighting with both hope and might
Glorious powers
Side by side we stand and fall
Twilight Force

For the urge to revive

Eyes are burning bright
And we gaze into galaxies
And the distant skies are burning bright
So rise

Lo and behold, I come to you, finally

Storms are coming from the mountain
Casting a shadow on fate of men
Higher, fly higher and higher
Victorious whispering winds

He raised his sword in furious anger
A strike of lightning struck at his side
That night, the unholy forcelord
Fell by the hand of light

Thousands of universes burn before my eyes
Tales of ancient prophecies
Came true and left again
History was carved anew
And lit the hope of men
And the knights of twilight's might will rise again

For the power of the ancient force
Stars are shining
Riding on the winds of light
Twilight Force

Fighting with both hope and might
Glorious powers
Side by side we stand and fall
Twilight Force

For the urge to revive
