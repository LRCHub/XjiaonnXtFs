Stars are shining, on a bright night
A hero is rising, guided by light
Fire, glorious fire
Burning within his heart
In a land of mighty warriors
Honour and glory, eternally
Wisdom, oh, holy wisdom
Dwelling within his sword
Thousands of universes
Burn before my eyes
Tales of ancient prophecies
Came true and left again
History was carved anew
And lit the hope of men,
And the knights of twilight's might
Will rise again
For the power of the ancient force
Stars are shining
Riding on the winds of light
Twilight force
Fighting with both hope and might
Glorious powers
Side by side we stand and fall
Twilight force
"For the urge to revive"
Eyes are burning bright, and we gaze
Into galaxies
And the distant skies are burning
Bright, so rise
"Lo and behold, I come to you, finally"
Storms are coming, from the mountain
Casting a shadow, on fate of men
Higher, fly higher and higher
Victorious whispering winds
He raised his sword in furious anger
A strike of lightning struck at his side
That night, the unholy Forcelord
Fell by the hand of light
Thousands of universes
Burn before my eyes
Tales of ancient prophecies
Came true and left again
History was carved anew
And lit the hope of men
And the knights of twilight's might
Will rise again
For the power of the ancient force
Stars are shining
Riding on the winds of light
Twilight force
Fighting with both hope and might
Glorious powers
Side by side we stand and fall
Twilight force
"For the urge to revive"
